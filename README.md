# Helios Docs Capstone Project - Matthew Sparkman 2025

## Project Overview
This document summarizes my work on the Helios Docs capstone project - a collaborative document editing platform with real-time editing, user authentication, chat functionality, and document sharing capabilities.

## 1. Itemized List of My Contributions

### Frontend Components & Pages
- **Authentication System**: 
  - Sign-in page (`/signin/+page.svelte`)
  - Sign-up page (`/signup/+page.svelte`) 
  - Onboarding page (`/onboarding/+page.svelte`)
- **Core Application Pages**:
  - Home dashboard (`/home/+page.svelte`)
  - Documents listing (`/docs/+page.svelte`)
  - Document editor (`/docs/[id]/+page.svelte`)
  - Shared documents (`/shared/+page.svelte`) 
  - Chat system (`/chats/+page.svelte`)
  - Error page (`/error/+page.svelte`)
- **Reusable Components**:
  - Document editor component
  - Document preview component
  - Document search component
  - Chat components (sidebar, view, messages)
  - Header and navigation components
  - Profile management component
  - File sharing buttons/modals

### Styling & UI Design
- **Comprehensive CSS**:
  - Created full styling system (`styles.css`)
  - Implemented dark/light theme toggle
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop
  - Custom animations and transitions

### Backend Integration
- **Firebase Configuration**:
  - Authentication setup
  - Firestore database integration
  - Security rules implementation
  - Storage setup for document data

### Project Location
All project files are stored in a private GitHub repository. The main application files can be found at:
- Frontend: `src/routes/` (containing all page components)
- Components: `src/lib/components/`
- Services: `src/lib/services/`
- Utilities: `src/lib/util/`
- Styling: `src/styles.css`

## 2. Most Significant Success
My most significant success was building a real-time document editing system that worked smoothly for many users at once. This required careful work with Svelte's reactivity, Firebase's real-time database, and custom logic to handle editing conflicts. Watching users make changes at the same time and seeing updates appear right away was very satisfying.

## 3. Biggest Failure
The biggest challenge was improving the application for mobile devices. Although I later created a responsive design, the first version had major usability problems on smaller screens. The document editor was especially hard to adjust for touch use while keeping all features. Starting with a mobile-first design would have made this easier to handle.

## 4. Exceeding Expectations
As this was a solo project, I set my own goals and worked to go beyond them by adding features not included in the original plan. One example was adding more complex user roles for better security and site usability.

## 5. What I Learned
This project improved my skills in:
- Building real-time collaborative applications
- Working with Firebase for authentication and data storage
- Creating responsive, accessible UI components
- Implementing state management
- Writing clean, maintainable code for a large-scale application
- Managing both frontend and backend aspects of a full-stack project
- Handling security concerns related to document sharing and user permissions

## 6. What I Wished I Had Learned
I wish I had learned more about automated testing for complex real-time applications. The only testing I completed was manual, either by myself or through feedback from friends when the site was nearly finished. Automated testing would have been more reliable and helped find unusual issues earlier.

## 7. What I Would Have Done Better
I would have improved my project planning process. Although I finished all required features, my original timeline did not account for the difficulty of building real-time collaboration, which caused some rushed work near the end of the semester.

## 8. How the Project Could Have Been Better
The project could have benefited from:
- Additional collaborative features like comments and suggesting mode
- More refined mobile experience
- Integration with popular third-party services (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Implementation of a more sophisticated text editor/formatting tool

## 9. Primary Contributor
As this was a solo project, I was the primary contributor to all aspects of the application, from initial design to final implementation.

## 10. Biggest Challenges
Working alone on a project of this size made time management and staying motivated difficult. Looking back, dividing the work into smaller tasks with clear deadlines would have helped keep steady progress through the semester.

## 11. Progress Tracking
As a solo developer, I used a personal task tracking system in Notion to manage progress, and eventually I used my own editor to track my process which was pretty cool. This helped me choose which features to focus on, and keep track of bugs. This helped me stay organized and focus on the most important parts of the project at each stage.

## 12. Additional Accomplishments
In addition to the core requirements, I added:
- A theming system with a dark/light mode toggle
- Animated UI transitions for a smooth appearance
- Clear error handling across the application
- Security steps to protect user data and documents

## 13. Course Grade Justification
I believe I deserve an A in this course. I completed a fully working application that met all project requirements while working alone. The project shows my skill in modern web development, my ability to build complex systems, and my focus on creating a clear and usable product. I also added features beyond the basic requirements and aimed to produce a version that could theoretically be deployed to real users.
